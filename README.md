PROJECT: This repository is for viewing purposes only. It is a public version of a repository that I created to analyze a tenant satisfaction survey as an Applied Data Fellow in Cook County's Bureau of Asset Management. The sensitive information from the original repository has been removed, including not only the survey results but instructional information for future users of the repository who wish to analyze future surveys. The goal of this project was to make the survey analysis process simple, allowing the user to save a satisfaction survey downloaded from Microsoft Folder as current_survey.xlsx in the current_survey folder and run the R scripts in this repository to essentially automate the cleaning and analysis process and generate quadrant plots, wordclouds, and tables that the user could then use in a presentation of the survey results. The R scripts contained in this public version of the repository will not run properly, due to the fact that these supporting files have been removed. If these files were included, when run, the R scripts would read current_survey.xlsx, as well as past survey results from the references/past_surveys folder and output tables showing how the results compare to those from previous years.
